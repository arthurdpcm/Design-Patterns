# Singleton

Ensure that a class has only one instance in the program and provide a global access point to it.
Generally used to access shared resources, such as interfaces, databases and file systems.

Can replace global variables. Singleton it protects the instance, leaving it private in the class.

Can be problematic in cases of concurrency.
